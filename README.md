The Historical Uyghur-Chinese Corpus consists of a sample set of public documents produced in both Uyghur and Chinese since the late Qing period up to the present day. The term “public documents” here refers to documents or texts issued by a Qing or Chinese administration for public use, such as laws, proclamations, announcements, official journals, newspapers, and books. The purpose of the corpus is to document and illustrate official translation practices and policies in Inner Asian territories regarding the Chinese and Uyghur languages during this period.
The total number of documents in various forms of Uyghur language in our corpus is just over 200, and for each of these we have included the Chinese version from which these were translated. 78 Chinese-language documents in the RB sub-collection have been included for comparative purposes even though they were not translated into Uyghur.
The project focused on preparing metadata, OCR, text extraction, clean-up and pre-processing of the source material, NLP processing (word chunking, POS tagging and lemmatization), creation of wordlists and bilingual file-alignment.
The corpus is arranged in six sub-collections. Each sub-collection represents documents produced by or during a different administration or a different type of document produced by an administration. The sub-collections include the following types of texts:

QA – 12 archival documents from the Qing period. Four of these documents are commemorative inscriptions, four are public notice inscriptions, one is a legal document, one is a description of a painting, one is a biography, one is a government-issued travel document and one is a commentary on certain Imperial pronouncements on morality. All the texts are bilingual. Nine documents date from the 1760s to the 1790s, two from 1877-1880, and one from the 1900s.

QB – 50 archival documents from the Qing period. These are all documents issued by the Chinese administration at the time. All the texts are bilingual. The publication dates span from the 1880s to the 1910s.

RA – Five archival documents or texts from the Republican Period (1912-49). Two are the texts of bank notes (RA001 and RA002), one is the text of a coin (RA003), one is a dictionary preface (RA004) and one is a government announcement (RA005). All the texts are bilingual. Their publication dates span from 1920 to 1947.

RB – 112 articles in Chinese from Mengzang yuebao (“Mongolian and Tibetan Monthly”), the monthly journal published by the Republic of China’s Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. 34 of the articles are paired with their translations into Uyghur, as published by the journal. These documents were published in the early 40s.

PA – 50 legal documents from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) period (from 1949). The documents are all regulations or laws issued by the PRC government. All the documents are bilingual and are sentence-aligned. The documents date from the late 1980s up to 2007.

PC – 50 articles from Qiushi (“Seeking Truth”), a bimonthly journal published by the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China. The articles consist of theoretical discussions of government policies. The publication dates span from the 1994 to 2000.

<b>Historical Forms of Uyghur in the Corpus: </b>
Since 1949, the language now known as Uyghur has become increasingly standardised. Earlier forms of the language are distinctive in a number of ways. To refer to the language found in documents issued before 1921 we have used the contemporary term “Turki” rather than the term “Turkic”, which is more commonly used in English to refer in general to cultures and languages which are cognate with Turkish culture or language.
The language used in the non-Chinese texts in the QA, QB and RA subcollections (except for RA004) is relatively close to modern Uyghur apart from some orthographic features and a small number of morphological features. The writers of these documents use traditional Turkish-Arabic script found in Central Asia and tried to reproduce local spellings to make their content widely accessible. There are some linguistic variations within the QB sub-collection, because some of the texts were written by people from Russia.

The language and script used in the Turki documents in the RB sub-collection, and in RA004, dating from between 1921 and 1949, differ from those used in the earlier documents.<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> These reflect the attempt during that period to create a hybrid form of Turki with significant lexical borrowings from the Ottoman and Central-Asian Turkic languages, a project that continued from the end of the Qing empire in 1912 until the mid-40s. In line with the pan-Turkish ideology of that time, the authors followed Ottoman Turkish script and orthography as well as lexicon. As a result, to understand the texts, the readers needed a good knowledge of Ottoman Turkish and of local spoken Turki.<a href="#note2" id="note2ref"><sup>2</sup></a> An NLP model trained on modern Uyghur would certainly fail in the processing of documents using this form of Turki.
Both the language used in the QA, QB and RA documents and the language used in the RB documents (plus RA0004) coexisted: the former was widely used by the local population during the Republican period, while the new hybrid Turkic language started to be used in some official documents after the 1910s by some central government institutions.

The language used in the PA and PC sub-collections is standard modern Uyghur as developed after 1949. As for the script, three reforms were introduced by the PRC after 1949, and the current form of the script differs significantly from that found in the earlier documents.

<b>Historical Forms of Chinese in the Corpus: </b>
Two documents in the corpus are written in standard classical Chinese: QA001 and QA006. The other documents in the QA sub-collection use more colloquial linguistic forms and terms than found in mainstream classical Chinese texts, such as the Four Classics. This form of the language is somewhat similar to modern Chinese apart from some features that reflect the spoken language of that time.<a href="#note3" id="note1ref"><sup>3</sup></a> The language used in the QB documents (and in QA010, RA001, RA002, RA003, and RA005) uses a different register from that found in most of the QA documents and is even closer to spoken Chinese language of the time, apart from some bureaucratic forms of address at the beginning and at the end of the texts. It is thus not so remote from modern Chinese.

The language used in the RB sub-collection and in RA004 is Republican Chinese. While modern Chinese is a continuation of the official language used during the Qing empire and is mostly based on Beijing Chinese, Republican Chinese was based on the literature and the language used by Republican officials, who were mainly from southern China. These officials included some Japanese idiomatic expressions in their writings. Republican Chinese is similar to modern Chinese in terms of morphology and differs mostly in terms of lexicon.

The language used in the PA and PC sub-collections is standard modern Chinese as found within the PRC.
The texts in the QA, QB, RA and RB sub-collections use traditional Chinese characters, while the texts in the PA and PC sub-collections use simplified Chinese characters.

<b>Project Team and Funding: </b> 
The Corpus is the result of a pilot project entitled “History and Politics of Translation: Chinese Public Documents in Inner Asia – Uyghur-Language Module" (2019-2021), which was generously funded by Hong Kong Baptist University through a Hong Kong Baptist University Research Committee Initiation Grant (Faculty Niche Research Areas (IG-FNRA) 2018/19-ARTS-03). The Project PI was Jessica Yeung; the Co-Is were Mark Shuttleworth and Jean-Pierre Cabestan; project design and coordination were by Robert Barnett. Project team members were Merhaba Eli, Christian Faggionato, Ahmet Hojam,Sezen Özkan, Rune Steenberg. Additional team members included Jenny Li, Phoebe Shing,and Aynur Muhammed. Project Consultants included Nathan Hill and David Brophy.

<a id="note1" href="#note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a>The RB documents in Turki and RA004 were all translated from Chinese by the same translator or group of translators, working for the Mongolian and Chinese Affairs Commission.

<a id="note2" href="#note2ref"><sup>2</sup></a>Documents RA003 and RA005 show some influences from the forms of language found in the RB sub-collection, since they adopt a higher register in their lexicon and use an orthography similar to that found in the RB documents.
