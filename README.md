# The Historical Uyghur-Chinese Corpus
The Historical Uyghur-Chinese Corpus consists of a sample set of public documents produced in both Uyghur and Chinese since the late Qing period up to the present day. The term “public documents” here refers to documents or texts issued by a Qing or Chinese administration for public use, such as laws, proclamations, announcements, official journals, newspapers, and books. The purpose of the corpus is to document and illustrate official translation practices and policies in Inner Asian territories regarding the Chinese and Uyghur languages during this period.
The total number of documents in various forms of Uyghur language in our corpus is 279, and for 201 of these we have included the Chinese version from which these were translated. 78 Chinese-language documents in the RB sub-collection have been included for comparative purposes even though they were not translated into Uyghur.
The project focused on preparing metadata, OCR, text extraction, clean-up and pre-processing of the source material, NLP processing (word chunking, POS tagging and lemmatization), creation of wordlists and bilingual file-alignment.
The corpus is arranged in six sub-collections. Each sub-collection represents documents produced by or during a different administration or a different type of document produced by an administration. The sub-collections include the following types of texts:

QA – 12 archival documents from the Qing period. Four of these documents are commemorative inscriptions, four are public notice inscriptions, one is a legal document, one is a description of a painting, one is a biography, one is a government-issued travel document and one is a commentary on certain Imperial pronouncements on morality. All the texts are bilingual. Nine documents date from the 1760s to the 1790s, two from 1877-1880, and one from the 1900s.

QB – 50 archival documents from the Qing period. These are all documents issued by the Chinese administration at the time. All the texts are bilingual. The publication dates span from the 1880s to the 1910s.

RA – Five archival documents or texts from the Republican Period (1912-49). Two are the texts of bank notes (RA001 and RA002), one is the text of a coin (RA003), one is a dictionary preface (RA004) and one is a government announcement (RA005). All the texts are bilingual. Their publication dates span from 1920 to 1947.

RB – 112 articles in Chinese from Mengzang yuebao (“Mongolian and Tibetan Monthly”), the monthly journal published by the Republic of China’s Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. 34 of the articles are paired with their translations into Uyghur, as published by the journal. These documents were published in the early 40s.

PA – 50 legal documents from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) period (from 1949). The documents are all regulations or laws issued by the PRC government. All the documents are bilingual and are sentence-aligned. The documents date from the late 1980s up to 2007.

PC – 50 articles from Qiushi (“Seeking Truth”), a bimonthly journal published by the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China. The articles consist of theoretical discussions of government policies. The publication dates span from the 1994 to 2000.
